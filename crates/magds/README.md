Multi-Associative Graph Data Structure (MAGDS) are self-organizing graphs that facilitates and significantly accelerates various operations, especially the search for data relationships. Many useful relationships can be directly represented and automatically updated in this structure without searching for them using specialized algorithms. MAGDS associates data, keeping them within easy reach. This paper presents how extra relationships can enrich typical data stored in rela-tional databases and how to quickly find associa-tions in this structure. Various search and data mining operations that can be performed faster on MAGDS than on database tables. This structure can be used for knowledge discovery, associative se-mantic memories, and machine learning.
