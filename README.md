# let magic happen
witchnet is a biologically inspired associative neural network that can act as a database or knowledge graph, and may perform any machine learning and artificial intelligence task

## project structure
this repo is composed of the following subprojects:
- witchnet-common  
  a collection of traits, functions, consts and structures for associative structures related to the witchnet project
- asa-graphs  
  self-balancing, aggregating, and sorting tree-like data structures for efficient data representation
- magds  
  self-organizing graphs that facilitates and significantly accelerates various operations, especially the search for data relationships
